Xamarin Dev Days are community driven, hands-on learning experiences geared towards beginner mobile developers to help build, test, and connect native iOS, Android, and Windows apps.

Explore mobile development with free training courses from Xamarin experts and local community members. Then, after lunch, get the opportunity to put new knowledge into practice by building a cross-platform, cloud-connected app with Xamarin and Azure in Visual Studio.

Inside this repo you will find all of the presentations, demos, and hands-on labs that you will experience at Xamarin Dev Days!
